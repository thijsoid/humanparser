                <p>The <b>Human Parser</b> game is accompanied by a thesis -- a text-adventure itself. This document contextualizes the game while telling an intimate story about dissociation, 'living with a manual' and the inescapable loudness of the question 'who am I'?</p>

                <p><b>Human Parser</b> is a pen-and-paper text-adventure game about (not) understanding yourself. It is a game for 2 people, played anywhere, in 30-or-so minutes. It is a game about dissociation, about how hard it is to understand eachother, and how beautiful it is to try anyway.</p>
                <p><b>Human Parser</b> was developed as part of my graduation research for the Master in Fine Art and Design: <a href="https://xpub.nl/">Experimental Publishing</a>. Through a series of performative game-like moments and conversation based playtesting sessions, dissociation was explored through the lenses of text-adventures. </p>
